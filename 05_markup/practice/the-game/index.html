    <h1>massive team battles</h1>
    <p>It's great to dream of being the ace who saves the day, but it's only through teamwork that you and your allies prevail. 30 tanks split between two teams battle for supremacy on over a dozen intricately-designed maps. </p>

    <h1>multiple game modes</h1>
    <p>World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes: Standard, 
        Encounter, and Assault. Standard battles are intense "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt to secure the opposing base. Encounter battles offer only one base to capture, </p>
    <p>and teams fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. In Assault mode, players get a pitched battle between attackers and 
        defenders during a single-base 
        engagement.</p>
