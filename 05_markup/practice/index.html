        <h3>Multiple Game Modes</h3>
        <p>World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes: Standard, 
            Encounter, and Assault. Standard battles are intense "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt to secure the opposing base. 
            Encounter battles offer only one base to capture, and teams fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. 
            In Assault mode, players get a pitched battle between attackers and defenders during a single-base engagement.</p>
